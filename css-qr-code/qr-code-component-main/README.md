## My process

First of all, I decided to come with the mobile solution, so the first step is learn how to use **media queries** on css to design the mobile layout, and then, continue with the desktop one.

It was difficult for me at the beggining since I didn't know how to create the container or in this case the card, so I followed old code that I had made and guide myself, *at least* to make it work, so far, it seems to be working well.

...

After a short period of work and try and fail progress, I could handle how to make it work. I could create the responsive part, in fact, I learned that there should be create firstly the responsive part, then the tablet and desktop one.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Media Queries ```CSS```

### What I learned

First of all, I learned that understanding **GIT** it's essential, it allows you to stick with the flow of the creation of the application

I'm very proud that I could also learn how to create a responsive website by using **media-queries**

```CSS
@media (max-width: 480px) {

  .container {
    
    margin: 10% auto;
    width: 275px;
    padding: 24px;
    border-radius: 16px;
    box-shadow: 0px 0px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, .30);
    overflow: hidden;
    height: 425px;
    transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;

  }
}

```

I learned how to center a div effectively, and now, the last part is the usefulness of knowing how to share my progress with other people, as if I were in a pro team

**Small detail:** The use of "transitions" in CSS which makes the website modern and smooth, also catchy as a result of the transitions.

### Continued development

I want to keep focusing my efforts in learning CSS and responsive design, in order to create better websites in the future ðŸ”®
